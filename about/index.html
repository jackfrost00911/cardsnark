            Most credit card advice is written by guys in suits who haven't worried about an overdraft fee since 1998. We're different.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Origin Story (It’s Not Glamorous)</h2>
        <p>CardSnark started with a simple realization: <strong>Credit card companies rely on you being confused.</strong></p>
        <p>They use terms like "APR," "variable prime rates," and "revolving utilization" to keep you in the dark while they quietly siphon 25% interest from your paycheck. I was tired of seeing my friends get fleeced by predatory lenders just because they didn't understand the fine print.</p>
        <p>So, I built this site. It’s not run by a hedge fund. It’s run on caffeine and spite.</p>

                    If we can't explain a credit card benefit in plain English, it's probably a scam. We translate "banker" into "human."
