    <span class="hero-badge">OUR MISSION</span>
    <h1>We're Not Bankers.<br>Thank God.</h1>
    <p>Most credit card advice is written by guys in suits who haven't worried about an overdraft fee since 1998. We're different.</p>

    <h2>The Origin Story (It’s Not Glamorous)</h2>
    <p>CardSnark started with a simple realization: <strong>Credit card companies rely on you being confused.</strong></p>
    <p>They use terms like "APR," "variable prime rates," and "revolving utilization" to keep you in the dark while they quietly siphon 25% interest from your paycheck. I was tired of seeing my friends get fleeced by predatory lenders just because they didn't understand the fine print.</p>
    <p>So, I built this site. It’s not run by a hedge fund. It’s run on caffeine and spite.</p>

    <h2>Our 3 Simple Rules</h2>
    <p>We are trying to compete with the giants like NerdWallet and Credit Karma, but without the corporate soul-crushing vibe. Here is how we operate:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. No Corporate Speak:</strong> If we can't explain a credit card benefit in plain English, it's probably a scam. We translate "banker" into "human."</li>
        <li><strong>2. Math > Marketing:</strong> Banks love to dangle "60,000 Points!" in front of you while hiding a $695 annual fee. We do the math to see if you actually come out ahead.</li>
        <li><strong>3. If It Sucks, We Say It Sucks:</strong> Most review sites are afraid to offend the banks. We aren't. If a card has predatory fees or garbage rewards, we will tell you to stay away.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>"Wait, how do you make money?"</h2>
    <p>Good question. We believe in radical transparency.</p>
    <p>CardSnark is free for you to use. We keep the lights on through <strong>affiliate commissions</strong>. This means if you click a link on our site and get approved for a card, the bank pays us a referral fee.</p>
    <p><strong>Here is the important part:</strong> This does not affect our reviews. We have trashed cards that pay high commissions because they were bad products. We have recommended cards that pay us nothing because they were great for students. </p>
    <p>We would rather be honest and poor than rich and liars. (Okay, rich and honest would be nice, but you get the point).</p>
