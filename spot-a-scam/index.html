            Scammers are getting smarter. They don't just send misspelt emails anymore. They spoof your bank's phone number, clone your friends' Instagram accounts, and promise to fix your credit overnight. Here is how to not get played.

        <h3>The "Credit Repair Guru" Scam</h3>
        <p>
            Since you are on this site, you probably care about your credit score. That makes you a target. Be very careful of Instagram/TikTok accounts promising to sell you a <strong>"CPN" (Credit Privacy Number)</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="font-bold text-yellow-900 m-0"><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation mr-2"></i> The Truth About CPNs</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-800 mt-2 m-0">
                A "CPN" is usually just a stolen Social Security Number from a child or a deceased person. If you use one to apply for credit, <strong>you are committing federal identity theft</strong>. Do not buy these.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The "Bank Fraud Alert" Scam</h3>
        <p>
            This is the most dangerous one right now. You get a text that looks <em>exactly</em> like it came from Chase or Wells Fargo:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 italic p-4 text-gray-600">
            "CHASE ALERT: Did you spend $4,000 at Apple Store? Reply N if no."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You panic and reply "N". Immediately, your phone rings. It's a "Chase Agent" (spoofed number) telling you they need to verify your identity to stop the charge. They ask for your <strong>2-Factor Auth code</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Reality:</strong> They are trying to log into your account. That code was for a password reset. You just gave them the keys to the castle.
        </p>

        <h3>What To Do If You Get Got</h3>
        <p>Listen, it happens. If you messed up, move fast:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Freeze Your Credit:</strong> Go to Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax right now and freeze everything. It's free.</li>
            <li><strong>Call Your Bank:</strong> Use the number on the <em>back of your card</em>, not the number that called you.</li>
            <li><strong>Change Passwords:</strong> If you use the same password for everything, change it all. Start using a password manager like Bitwarden.</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="mt-16 text-center">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Want to fix your credit the legal way?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-500 mb-8">No scams, just math and patience.</p>
