        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b-2 border-indigo-500 pb-2 inline-block">How We Make Money</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            CardSnark is an independent credit card comparison and review website. We earn revenue through affiliate partnerships with credit card issuers and financial institutions. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 font-bold text-indigo-700 bg-indigo-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100">
            Basically: When you click a link on our site and get approved for a card, the bank pays us a commission. It costs you nothing extra.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Affiliate Relationships</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We maintain affiliate relationships with various providers, including:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Major banks (Chase, American Express, Citi, Discover, Capital One, etc.)</li>
            <li>Regional banks and credit unions</li>
            <li>Credit monitoring services</li>
            <li>Financial comparison platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            <strong>This is the important part:</strong> Our reviews are based on objective analysis. We evaluate cards based on rewards, fees, bonuses, and perks.
        </p>

                <h3 class="font-bold text-green-800 mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-check mr-2"></i> What We Do</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-green-700">We recommend cards that actually provide value. If a card sucks, we say it sucks, even if they would pay us to say otherwise.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-red-200">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-red-800 mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark mr-2"></i> What We Don't Do</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-red-700">We do not let banks review, approve, or edit our content before it is published. Our snark is 100% our own.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Not All Links Pay Us</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            Sometimes the best card on the market doesn't have an affiliate program. We recommend it anyway. Our goal is to be the most trustworthy resource on the internet, not the most profitable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">FTC Compliance</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's requirements for affiliate relationships and endorsements (16 CFR Part 255). We believe in transparency because we respect your intelligence.
