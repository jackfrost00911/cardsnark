            <p class="text-blue-800 leading-relaxed">
                CardSnark is an independent website. When you click a link to apply for a credit card, the bank pays us a commission if you are approved. <strong>This costs you nothing.</strong> It's how we keep the site free without annoying pop-up ads.
            </p>

        <h2>Our 3 Rules of Business</h2>
        <p>We operate under a simple ethical code:</p>
        
        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8 not-prose">
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 shadow-sm">
                <div class="text-green-600 font-black text-xl mb-2">✅ What We Do</div>
                <p class="text-sm">We recommend cards that are mathematically good. If a card has great rewards and low fees, we tell you to get it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 shadow-sm">
                <div class="text-red-600 font-black text-xl mb-2">❌ What We Don't Do</div>
                <p class="text-sm">We never let banks review, edit, or approve our content before publishing. Our snark is 100% our own.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Who We Work With</h2>
        <p>We maintain affiliate relationships with many major financial institutions, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>American Express</li>
            <li>Chase</li>
            <li>Capital One</li>
            <li>Citi</li>
            <li>Discover</li>
            <li>Wells Fargo</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, we also review cards from banks that <strong>pay us nothing</strong> (like certain credit unions or smaller issuers) because our loyalty is to the reader, not the bank.</p>

        <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
        <p>This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on endorsements and testimonials (16 CFR Part 255). We believe in following the rules because we respect your intelligence.</p>
