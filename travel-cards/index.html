        <h2>How to Choose a Travel Card (Without a Spreadsheet)</h2>
        <p>Travel credit cards are complicated on purpose. They want you to get distracted by "3X Points" and forget about the $500 annual fee. Here is the simple math to decide which tier you belong in.</p>

        <h3>Tier 1: The "Once a Year" Traveler ($0 - $95 Fee)</h3>
        <p>If you only fly home for Christmas and maybe take one vacation, do not get a luxury card. You won't use the perks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Look for:</strong> Low annual fees and points that don't expire.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Cards with "Statement Credits" that require you to buy things you don't need.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Pick:</strong> Chase Sapphire Preferred.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tier 2: The "Digital Nomad" / Business Traveler ($250+ Fee)</h3>
        <p>If you are in an airport more than 5 times a year, lounge access becomes a mental health necessity, not a luxury.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Look for:</strong> Priority Pass Select (Lounge access) and TSA PreCheck credits.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Pick:</strong> Capital One Venture X (It effectively pays you to keep it).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The "Golden Rule" of Travel Points</h3>
        <p>Never redeem points for cash back on Amazon. That is how the banks win. 60,000 Chase points are worth $600 on Amazon, but they can be worth $1,200 if you transfer them to Hyatt or United Airlines.</p>
