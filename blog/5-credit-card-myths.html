            <!-- Myth 1 -->
            <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                <div class="flex items-center mb-4">
                    <span class="bg-red-500 text-white w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold mr-3">1</span>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 m-0">Myth: Carrying a Balance Boosts Your Score</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>The Truth:</strong> Nope. Paying interest is not a prize. Your credit score loves it when you pay your bill in full, not when you gift the bank free money every month.
                </p>
                <div class="mt-4 p-4 bg-green-50 text-green-800 rounded-lg text-sm border border-green-100">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle mr-2"></i> <strong>Better Move:</strong> Pay it off every single month. $0 interest is the goal.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Myth 2 -->
            <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                <div class="flex items-center mb-4">
                    <span class="bg-red-500 text-white w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold mr-3">2</span>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 m-0">Myth: Closing Cards is Always Bad</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>The Truth:</strong> Sure, closing an old account might ding your score a tiny bit temporarily (because it lowers your total credit limit), but keeping fee-laden, unused cards “just for your score” makes no sense.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    If you’re done with a card—especially one charging you a $95 annual fee for perks you don't use—<strong>cut it loose.</strong> Your wallet (and sanity) will thank you.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Myth 3 -->
            <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                <div class="flex items-center mb-4">
                    <span class="bg-red-500 text-white w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold mr-3">3</span>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 m-0">Myth: More Cards = More Debt</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>The Truth:</strong> Credit cards don't spend money; <em>you</em> spend money. Having multiple cards just means you have more total credit available.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    Actually, having more credit available but using very little of it (low utilization) boosts your score significantly. Self-control, people. It’s a vibe.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Myth 4 -->
            <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                <div class="flex items-center mb-4">
                    <span class="bg-red-500 text-white w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold mr-3">4</span>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 m-0">Myth: Rewards Cards Are a Trap</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>The Truth:</strong> Only if you’re bad at math. Used right, rewards cards pay you for spending you’d do anyway.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    If you buy $500 of groceries with debit, you spent $500. If you buy it with a <a href="/reviews/blue-cash-preferred.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-bold">Blue Cash Preferred</a>, you spent $470 (after 6% cash back). Who is the trap really for?
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Myth 5 -->
            <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                <div class="flex items-center mb-4">
                    <span class="bg-red-500 text-white w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold mr-3">5</span>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 m-0">Myth: Applying for Cards Tanks Your Score</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>The Truth:</strong> A hard inquiry drops your score by maybe 5 points. It bounces back in a few months.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    Unless you are applying for a mortgage next week, don't sweat a 5-point drop to get a $200 sign-up bonus. The math is in your favor.
                </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Credit cards aren’t evil. They’re power tools. Use them correctly, and you build something great. Use them wrong, and you lose a finger. Unpack the myths, pay attention, and you might actually come out ahead.
