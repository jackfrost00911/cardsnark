    <h1>5 Credit Card Myths That Need to Die (Right Now)</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the wonderful world of credit cards—the plastic rectangle people love to hate and hate to understand. Let's torch five old-school myths that keep people broke, stressed, or living in fear of their next billing cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #1: Carrying a Balance Boosts Your Score</h2>
    <p>
        Nope. Paying interest is not a prize. Your credit score loves it when you pay your bill in full, not when you gift the bank free money every month.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #2: Closing Cards is Always Bad</h2>
    <p>
        Sure, closing an old account might ding your score a bit, but keeping fee-laden, unused cards “just for your score” makes no sense. If you’re done with a card (especially one with an annual fee), call it quits.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #3: More Cards = More Debt</h2>
    <p>
        Having multiple cards just means more lines of credit—and a healthier score if you don’t spend like a caffeinated teenager. Self-control, people. It’s a vibe.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #4: Rewards Cards Are a Trap</h2>
    <p>
        Only if you’re bad at math and discipline. Used right, rewards cards pay you for spending you’d do anyway. Used wrong, well… buy three years of ramen and call it a life lesson.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #5: Applying for Cards Tanks Your Score Forever</h2>
    <p>
        A hard inquiry drops your score by a handful of points—and it bounces back. If you don’t apply for five cards a week, you’ll survive.
    </p>

    <h2>The Real Truth</h2>
    <p>
        Credit cards aren’t evil. They’re tools, and sometimes really profitable ones. Unpack the myths, pay attention, and you might actually come out ahead.
