        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It’s the first week of the semester. You’re walking through the quad, trying to find a building that doesn't exist on the map, when you see it: A table. A clipboard. And a stack of warm, greasy pizza boxes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            A friendly recruiter waves you over. "Hey! Want a free slice? Just fill out this form for a credit card! You get a free T-shirt too!"
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-bold text-xl mb-8">
            Stop. Drop the pizza. Walk away.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            That recruiter does not care about your credit score. They get paid a commission for every warm body they sign up. If you sign that form without reading the fine print, you aren't getting "free lunch"—you are potentially signing up for a predatory nightmare that will haunt your credit report until you're 30.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The "Student Card" Advantage</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Here is the irony: While some student cards are scams, the <em>good</em> student cards are actually better than the cards your parents have.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Banks are desperate to hook you young. They know if you get their card now, you’ll probably keep it forever because changing banks is "too much effort." To bribe you, they lower their standards. They don't require a massive credit history. They just need to know you are enrolled in school.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            You have a 4-year window to get approved for cards that would normally reject you. Don't waste this superpower on a card with a picture of a bulldog on it.
        </p>

                <strong>Snark Tip:</strong> If a "Pizza Plug" or someone on Instagram asks for your card details to get you "discounted food," that is not a student discount. That is a felony. It's called carding. Don't go to jail for Chipotle.

            If you see these names, hiss at them like a feral cat. These cards are "fee harvesters" designed to exploit people who don't know better.

            <li><strong>First Premier / Premier Bankcard:</strong> Known to charge "processing fees" just to open the account. You could pay $170 in fees for a $300 limit.</li>
            <li><strong>Any card that doesn't report to all 3 bureaus:</strong> If it doesn't build your credit score, it's not a credit card. It's a gift card with fees.</li>
