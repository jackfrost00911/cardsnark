        <p>Let’s get one thing straight: If you are currently using a debit card for your daily spending, please close this tab, go sit in the corner, and think about your life choices. You are literally paying a "fear tax" to the banks.</p>

        <p>For the rest of you—the ones who actually like free money—welcome. You’re probably earning 1% or maybe 1.5% cash back on your purchases. That’s cute. But it’s amateur hour.</p>

        <p>If you want to actually <em>make money</em> from your credit cards, you need a system. Don't worry, I’m not going to tell you to open 40 cards and tape labels to them like some sort of coupon-clipping psychopath. We’re going to do this the smart way.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: The "One Card" Myth</h2>
        <p>There is a persistent lie that you should just have "one good card" for everything. This is wrong. It is mathematically impossible for one card to be good at everything.</p>
        <p>If a card gives you great travel rewards, it probably sucks at groceries. If it gives you great gas rewards, it probably gives you nothing on dining.</p>
        <p>To max out your cash back, you need to accept the <strong>Trifecta Life</strong>. You need three specific tools in your wallet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Food Card:</strong> For dining and groceries (Aim for 4% - 6%).</li>
            <li><strong>The Commuter Card:</strong> For gas and transit (Aim for 3% - 5%).</li>
            <li><strong>The "Everything Else" Card:</strong> For the boring stuff (Aim for 2% flat).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="snark-box">
            <p><strong>Snark Tip:</strong> If you are paying for dinner with a card that earns 1% cash back, you might as well just tip the bank teller on your way out. Use the right card for the right purchase. It’s not rocket science.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Step 2: Stack, Don't Just Swipe</h2>
        <p>This is where the pros separate themselves from the casuals. Most people just swipe their card and take their 2%. Boring.</p>
        <p>You should be <strong>stacking</strong> rewards. This is the financial equivalent of a combo move in a fighting game.</p>
        <h3>The "Double Dip" Method:</h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 mb-8 space-y-4">
            <li><strong>Use a Shopping Portal:</strong> Never go directly to Nike.com or HomeDepot.com. Go to <strong>Rakuten</strong> or an airline shopping portal first. Click their link to get to the site. That’s an extra 2% - 10% cash back right there.</li>
            <li><strong>Pay with your Rewards Card:</strong> Now pay with your credit card. That’s another 2% - 5%.</li>
            <li><strong>The Result:</strong> You just got 12% off your purchase while everyone else paid full price. Congratulations, you’re winning capitalism.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 3: Merchant Offers are Free Money</h2>
        <p>Every major bank (Amex, Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo) has a section in their app called "Offers" or "Deals."</p>
        <p>Most people ignore this section because 90% of the offers are for wine subscriptions or overpriced meal kits. But buried in that pile of garbage are gems like <em>"10% back at Starbucks"</em> or <em>"$50 back at Hilton."</em></p>
        <p><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Once a week, while you’re ignoring your family or pretending to work, scroll through these offers and click "Add to Card" on anything you might actually use. It takes 30 seconds and saves you hundreds of dollars a year.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Rotating Categories (The Calendar Game)</h2>
        <p>I know, I know. "Rotating categories" sounds like work. Cards like the <strong>Discover it®</strong> or <strong>Chase Freedom Flex</strong> require you to "activate" a category every 3 months to get 5% back.</p>
        <p>Is it annoying? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes.</p>
        <p>Usually, Q4 (October - December) is <strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>Target</strong>. Getting 5% cash back on all your holiday shopping is huge. Set a reminder in your phone for the 1st of every quarter. Label it "Free Money Day." Click the button. Done.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Don't Hoard Your Cash</h2>
        <p>This is a controversial take, but I stand by it: <strong>Redeem your cash back often.</strong></p>
        <p>Some people treat their cash back balance like a high score in a video game. They let it sit there until it hits $1,000. This is stupid.</p>
        <p>Why? Because inflation exists. That $50 you earned last year is worth less today than it was then. Also, if the bank decides to close your account for any reason (it happens), they can forfeit your rewards. Don't let the bank hold your money interest-free.</p>
        <p>Take the cash. Put it in a High Yield Savings Account. Invest it. Buy a taco. Just don't leave it sitting in the bank's pocket.</p>
