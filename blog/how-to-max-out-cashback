            Let’s get one thing straight: If you are currently using a debit card for your daily spending, please close this tab, go sit in the corner, and think about your life choices. You are literally paying a "fear tax" to the banks.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For the rest of you—the ones who actually like free money—welcome. You’re probably earning 1% or maybe 1.5% cash back on your purchases. That’s cute. But it’s amateur hour.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            If you want to actually <em>make money</em> from your credit cards, you need a system. Don't worry, I’m not going to tell you to open 40 cards and tape labels to them like some sort of coupon-clipping psychopath. We’re going to do this the smart way.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 1: The "One Card" Myth</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            There is a persistent lie that you should just have "one good card" for everything. This is wrong. It is mathematically impossible for one card to be good at everything. If a card gives you great travel rewards, it probably sucks at groceries.
        </p>

                <strong>Snark Tip:</strong> If you are paying for dinner with a card that earns 1% cash back, you might as well just tip the bank teller on your way out. Use the right card for the right purchase. It’s not rocket science.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 2: Stack, Don't Just Swipe</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This is where the pros separate themselves from the casuals. Most people just swipe their card and take their 2%. Boring. You should be <strong>stacking</strong> rewards.
        </p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">The "Double Dip" Method:</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Use a Shopping Portal:</strong> Never go directly to Nike.com or HomeDepot.com. Go to <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">Rakuten</span> or an airline shopping portal first. Click their link to get to the site. That’s an extra 2% - 10% cash back right there.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay with your Rewards Card:</strong> Now pay with your credit card. That’s another 2% - 5%.</li>
                <li><strong>The Result:</strong> You just got 12% off your purchase while everyone else paid full price. Congratulations, you’re winning capitalism.</li>
            </ol>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 3: Merchant Offers are Free Money</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Every major bank (Amex, Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo) has a section in their app called "Offers" or "Deals." Most people ignore this section because 90% of the offers are for wine subscriptions or overpriced meal kits.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            But buried in that pile of garbage are gems like <em>"10% back at Starbucks"</em> or <em>"$50 back at Hilton."</em>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-bold mb-8">
            The Strategy: Once a week, while you’re ignoring your family or pretending to work, scroll through these offers and click "Add to Card." It takes 30 seconds and saves you hundreds of dollars a year.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 4: Rotating Categories (The Calendar Game)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            I know, I know. "Rotating categories" sounds like work. Cards like the <strong>Discover it®</strong> require you to "activate" a category every 3 months to get 5% back. Is it annoying? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Usually, Q4 (October - December) is <strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>Target</strong>. Getting 5% cash back on all your holiday shopping is huge. Set a reminder in your phone for the 1st of every quarter. Label it "Free Money Day." Click the button. Done.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 5 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Step 5: Don't Hoard Your Cash</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This is a controversial take, but I stand by it: <strong>Redeem your cash back often.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Some people treat their cash back balance like a high score in a video game. They let it sit there until it hits $1,000. This is stupid. Inflation exists. That $50 you earned last year is worth less today than it was then. Also, if the bank closes your account, they can forfeit your rewards.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-bold italic mb-8">
            Take the cash. Put it in a High Yield Savings Account. Invest it. Buy a taco. Just don't leave it sitting in the bank's pocket.
        </p>
