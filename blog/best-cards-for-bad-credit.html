        <p>So, you tanked your credit score. Maybe you missed a few payments, maybe you went through a divorce, or maybe you just spent your 20s thinking "Minimum Payment Due" was a suggestion. I’m not here to judge you (okay, maybe a little). I’m here to stop you from making it worse.</p>

        <p>When your credit is bad, sharks start circling. There are "credit card" companies whose entire business model is charging you $150 in fees for a card with a $300 limit. These are not credit cards; they are financial bear traps.</p>

        <p>If you want to rebuild, you need to swallow your pride and get a <strong>Secured Card</strong>. Yes, you have to give them a deposit. No, it’s not fair. But it’s the only way out of the hole.</p>

        <h2>The "Gold Standard": Discover it® Secured</h2>
        <p>This is the only secured card that doesn't treat you like a criminal. Most secured cards give you nothing. Discover actually pays you to fix your credit.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Good:</strong> It earns 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants. Yes, cash back on a secured card. That is unheard of.</li>
            <li><strong>The Better:</strong> They match all your cash back at the end of the first year.</li>
            <li><strong>The Best:</strong> After 7 months, they automatically check to see if they can give your deposit back and upgrade you to a "real" card.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you can scrape together the $200 deposit, get this card. It is arguably better than some unsecured cards for people with <em>good</em> credit.</p>

        <h2>The "I'm Broke" Option: Capital One Platinum Secured</h2>
        <p>Maybe you don't have $200. That’s fine. Being broke is expensive, I know.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Capital One Platinum Secured</strong> is unique because, depending on your credit profile, they might let you put down a deposit as low as <strong>$49</strong> or <strong>$99</strong> to get a $200 credit limit.</p>
        <p>Does it have rewards? No. Is it exciting? absolutely not. But it has <strong>No Annual Fee</strong>. Its only job is to exist, report "Paid on Time" to the credit bureaus every month, and eventually let you upgrade to a Quicksilver card.</p>

        <div class="snark-box">
            <p><strong>Snark Tip:</strong> If a card asks for an "Application Fee" or a "Processing Fee" before you are even approved, close the browser. Legitimate banks do not charge you an entrance fee like a cheesy nightclub.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The "I Hate Banks" Option: Chime Credit Builder</h2>
        <p>If traditional banks give you hives, there’s <strong>Chime</strong>. This isn't technically a credit card in the traditional sense, but it works like one for your credit report.</p>
        <p>You move money into the Credit Builder account, and that becomes your limit. You spend it, and it pays itself off.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Credit Check:</strong> They literally do not care about your score.</li>
            <li><strong>No Interest:</strong> Since you are spending your own money, there is no APR to worry about.</li>
            <li><strong>The Catch:</strong> You have to open a Chime checking account to get it. If you're cool with that, it's a foolproof way to build history without debt.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The "Dumpster Fire" List (AVOID THESE)</h2>
        <p>I cannot stress this enough: <strong>Do not get these cards.</strong> I don't care how desperate you are. I don't care if they send you a letter saying you are "Pre-Selected."</p>
        <p>These are "Fee-Harvester" cards. They exist to bleed you dry.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit One:</strong> Not to be confused with Capital One. Their logo looks similar on purpose. They often charge annual fees <em>billed monthly</em> just for having the account.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Visa / Premier / First Premier:</strong> These cards often have "Program Fees" of $95 just to open the account, plus a $75 annual fee, plus a monthly servicing fee. You will pay $170+ just to get a $300 limit. It is insanity.</li>
            <li><strong>Mission Lane (The "Maybe"):</strong> They aren't as bad as the others, but their fees are variable. You might get a $0 annual fee, or you might get slapped with $59. Proceed with extreme caution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Strategy</h2>
        <p>1. <strong>Get a Secured Card.</strong> Put down the deposit. Think of it as a savings account you can't touch.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Put ONE subscription on it.</strong> Put your Netflix ($15) on the card. Set up Auto-Pay to pay the full balance every month.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Cut the card up.</strong> I'm serious. Don't carry it. If you carry it, you will buy beer with it. Don't buy beer with it.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Wait 6-12 months.</strong> Your score will go up. The bank will mail your deposit back. You win.</p>
