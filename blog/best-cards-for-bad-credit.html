            Your credit score is trash. Let's fix it without setting your wallet on fire.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            So, you tanked your credit score. Maybe you missed a few payments, maybe you went through a divorce, or maybe you just spent your 20s thinking "Minimum Payment Due" was a suggestion. I’m not here to judge you (okay, maybe a little). I’m here to stop you from making it worse.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            When your credit is bad, sharks start circling. There are "credit card" companies whose entire business model is charging you $150 in fees for a card with a $300 limit. These are not credit cards; they are financial bear traps.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            If you want to rebuild, you need to swallow your pride and get a <strong>Secured Card</strong>. Yes, you have to give them a deposit. No, it’s not fair. But it’s the only way out of the hole.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                This is the only secured card that doesn't treat you like a criminal. Most secured cards give you nothing. Discover actually pays you to fix your credit.

                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-green-500 mr-2"></i> <strong>The Best:</strong> After 7 months, they automatically check to see if they can give your deposit back.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 italic">If you can scrape together the $200 deposit, get this card.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Maybe you don't have $200. That’s fine. Being broke is expensive, I know. The <strong>Capital One Platinum Secured</strong> is unique because, depending on your credit profile, they might let you put down a deposit as low as <strong>$49</strong> or <strong>$99</strong> to get a $200 credit limit.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Does it have rewards? No. Is it exciting? Absolutely not. But it has <strong>No Annual Fee</strong>. Its only job is to report "Paid on Time" to the credit bureaus every month.

            <p class="text-red-700 mb-4">I cannot stress this enough: <strong>Do not get these cards.</strong> They are "Fee-Harvester" cards designed to bleed you dry.</p>
            <ul class="space-y-2 text-red-700 text-sm">
                <li><strong>Credit One:</strong> Often charges fees <em>billed monthly</em> just for having the account.</li>

                <li><strong>Mission Lane:</strong> Variable fees. You might get a $0 annual fee, or you might get slapped with $59.</li>

        <!-- Chime Section -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">The "I Hate Banks" Option: Chime Credit Builder</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If traditional banks give you hives, there’s <strong>Chime</strong>. This isn't technically a credit card, but it works like one for your credit report. You move money into the Credit Builder account, and that becomes your limit. You spend it, and it pays itself off.
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8 bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <li><strong>No Credit Check:</strong> They literally do not care about your score.</li>
            <li><strong>No Interest:</strong> Since you are spending your own money, there is no APR.</li>
            <li><strong>The Catch:</strong> You have to open a Chime checking account to get it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Rebuilding Strategy</h2>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-12 font-medium">
            <li><strong>Get a Secured Card.</strong> Put down the deposit. Think of it as a savings account you can't touch.</li>
            <li><strong>Put ONE subscription on it.</strong> Put your Netflix ($15) on the card. Set up Auto-Pay to pay the full balance every month.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut the card up.</strong> I'm serious. Don't carry it. If you carry it, you will buy beer with it. Don't buy beer with it.</li>
            <li><strong>Wait 6-12 months.</strong> Your score will go up. The bank will mail your deposit back. You win.</li>
        </ol>
