        <h2>Do You Actually Need a Business Card?</h2>
        <p>There is a myth that you need an LLC, a storefront, and 5 employees to get a business credit card. <strong>That is false.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>Who Qualifies?</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li><strong>Freelancers:</strong> If you sell services (writing, design, consulting).</li>
            <li><strong>Gig Workers:</strong> Uber, DoorDash, TaskRabbit.</li>
            <li><strong>Online Sellers:</strong> eBay, Etsy, Poshmark.</li>
            <li><strong>Sole Proprietors:</strong> Anyone who makes money on the side.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="background: #eff6ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1e40af; font-weight: bold;">💡 The Application Hack</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">When the application asks for "Legal Business Name," just use <strong>your own name</strong>. <br>When it asks for "Business Structure," choose <strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong>. <br>You use your Social Security Number (SSN) instead of an EIN. This is 100% legal and standard.</p>

        <h2>Business vs. Personal Cards</h2>
        <p>Why bother getting a separate card? Three reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Tax Season Sanity:</strong> Mixing personal and business expenses is a nightmare during tax season. Keep them separate and your accountant will love you.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Reporting:</strong> Most business cards (Amex, Chase, Citi) do <strong>not</strong> report to your personal credit report. This means you can run up a high balance for inventory without tanking your personal credit score.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Limits:</strong> Business cards often have limits of $20k, $50k, or more because banks know businesses have higher expenses.</li>
        </ol>
