It gives you a massive 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets and on streaming services, plus 3% on gas. If your life revolves around feeding a family, driving them places, and watching Netflix when they finally fall asleep, this card is mathematically impossible to beat."

## The Deep Dive

It's rarely worth paying an annual fee for a cash back card, but the Blue Cash Preferred is the exception. 6% is a massive return. If you have a family, a car, or a mild addiction to streaming TV, this card pays for itself quickly.

### The Math (Is the Fee Worth It?)
The fee is $0 for the first year, then $95. Here is the math:

* **Annual Fee:** $95 (after year 1).
* **Disney Bundle Credit:** -$84 ($7/month back).
* **Net Annual Cost:** <strong class="text-blue-800">$11</strong>

**The Verdict:** Even without the Disney credit, you only need to spend $31/week on groceries to break even on the fee compared to a free card. If you spend more than that, the fee pays for itself.

### The 6% Grocery "Hack"
The headline feature is 6% back at U.S. Supermarkets (up to $6,000/year). If you don't spend that much on food, remember: **Grocery stores sell gift cards.**

Need to buy something at Amazon or Home Depot? Buy a gift card at Kroger using this card. You just got 6% cash back on lumber.

### Other Categories (The Commuter Special)
This is a killer card for commuters. You get 3% at the pump, but also 3% on transit, including trains, buses, taxis, rideshare (Uber/Lyft), parking lots, and tolls.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You spend at least $300/month at traditional supermarkets.
2.  You have a commute (gas or train).
3.  You subscribe to the Disney Bundle.
4.  You prefer simple Cash Back over complicated points.
