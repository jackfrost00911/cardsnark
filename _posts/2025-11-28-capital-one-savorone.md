## The Deep Dive

The SavorOne is, pound for pound, the best no-annual-fee card in existence. It covers the three things people actually spend money on: Food, Fun, and Groceries. If you don't want to pay $250 for the Amex Gold, get this.

### The Math (It's Free Real Estate)
There is literally no downside to holding this card. Even if you only use it once a month for a concert ticket, you're winning.

* **Annual Fee:** $0.
* **Foreign Transaction Fees:** $0.
* **Net Annual Cost:** <strong class="text-blue-800">$0</strong>

### The "Entertainment" Category (The Secret Weapon)
Most cards give you points for travel or food. The SavorOne gives you 3% back on "Entertainment." This is a surprisingly broad category that most other banks ignore. If you're buying Taylor Swift tickets or taking the kids to the zoo, this is the card to use.

* Movie Theaters
* Concerts & Music Festivals
* Sporting Events (NFL, NBA, MLB)
* Amusement Parks, Zoos, Aquariums
* Bowling Alleys & Pool Halls

### The Uber "Infinite Glitch"
Currently, Capital One has a partnership with Uber offering **10% Cash Back** on Uber rides and Uber Eats, plus a free **Uber One membership**. 

*Note: This benefit technically has an expiration date (usually listed as Nov 2024), but even if it goes away, the card is still amazing. If it stays, it's the best Uber card on the planet.*

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You eat out or order delivery more than you cook.
2.  You want a single card for groceries AND dining.
3.  You go to concerts, movies, or sporting events.
4.  You travel internationally but don't want to pay an annual fee.
