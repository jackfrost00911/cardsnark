verdict: "The Capital One Spark Cash Plus is not a normal credit card. It is a charge card. That means it has no pre-set spending limit, but you have to pay it off in full every month. In exchange for that discipline, Capital One gives you unlimited 2% cash back on every single purchase. No categories. No caps. Just a firehose of cash back."

## The Deep Dive

The Spark Cash Plus is a power tool for big spenders. Unlimited 2% back on massive transaction volumes adds up incredibly fast. If your business has the cash flow to support it, this card is a profit machine.

### The Math (Big Numbers Only)
If your business spends less than $150,000 a year, the $150 fee is annoying. If you spend MORE than $150k, this card is essentially free and earns uncapped 2% rewards.

* **Annual Fee:** $150.
* **Sign-up Bonus:** $1,200 (Requires $30k spend).
* **Fee Refund:** Spend $150k/year, get the $150 fee back.

### Charge Card vs. Credit Card
This is the most important distinction. A **Credit Card** has a limit and lets you pay minimums. A **Charge Card** (like this one) has no hard limit but requires full payment every month. If you run a company where you spend $50k+ a month and pay it off immediately, this card is a dream. If you are struggling with cash flow, this card is a nightmare.

### The "Personal Credit" Problem
This is Capital One's biggest flaw for business owners. Unlike Chase or Amex, Capital One **DOES** report business activity to your personal credit report. If you run up a $40,000 balance for your business, your personal credit score might drop because it looks like YOU personally owe $40,000.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  Your business spends over $150,000 a year (Fee becomes $0).
2.  You need to make purchases larger than a typical credit limit allows.
3.  You want simple cash back instead of confusing travel points.
