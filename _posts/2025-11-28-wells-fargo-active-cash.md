## The Deep Dive

The card for people who are tired of doing math at the checkout counter. It earns 2% cash back on everything, from diamond rings to breakfast burritos.

### The Math (It Just Works)
The $200 bonus is what sets this apart. Most 2% cards (like the Citi Double Cash) don't give you a bonus. Wells Fargo is paying you $200 just to try it out.

* **Annual Fee:** $0.
* **Cash Back Rate:** 2% Unlimited.
* **Sign-up Bonus:** $200 (after spending $500).

### Active Cash vs. Citi Double Cash
This is the heavyweight title fight of the boring credit card world. Both earn 2% on everything with $0 annual fees. However, Wells Fargo wins on two fronts: It usually has a **$200 Sign-Up Bonus** (Citi rarely does), and it includes **Cell Phone Protection** (Citi stripped most insurance benefits).

### The Cell Phone Protection (Hidden Gem)
This is rare for a no-fee card. If you pay your monthly cell phone bill with the Active Cash, you get up to **$600 of protection** against damage or theft. There is a $25 deductible, which is peanuts compared to the cost of a new iPhone screen.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You want one card for everything and hate tracking categories.
2.  You want a $200 bonus for very little spending ($500).
3.  You pay for cell phone insurance and want to stop paying for it.
