## The Deep Dive

The Citi Double Cash is the boring card that's actually brilliant. It does exactly one thing—earn 2% cash back on everything—and does it better than almost any other no-annual-fee card.

### How the 2% Cash Back Actually Works
The "double cash" name comes from Citi's unique earning structure:

* **1% cash back** when you make a purchase.
* **1% cash back** when you pay off that purchase.
* **Total:** 2% cash back on everything.

**Important:** If you carry a balance, you only earn the first 1% until you pay it down. This card rewards responsible behavior—pay your bill in full every month and you get the full 2%.

### Comparisons: Citi vs. The World
How does it stack up against other 2% cards?

* **vs. Wells Fargo Active Cash:** Both are 2% flat with $0 fees and 3% foreign fees. Wells Fargo adds cell phone protection ($600 coverage) if you pay your bill with the card. Citi adds better balance transfer options (18 months).
* **vs. Category Cards:** Cards like Discover it® earn 5% on rotating categories but require activation. If you value simplicity, use the Double Cash for everything. If you like maximizing, use Double Cash as your "catch-all" for non-category spend.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  People who want maximum cash back with zero effort.
2.  Anyone allergic to tracking categories or quarterly activations.
3.  Minimalists who want one card for everything.
