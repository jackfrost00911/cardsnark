verdict: "This is arguably the best 'starter' travel card on the market. If you can afford the $95 fee, the 60,000 point bonus (worth ~$750) pays for the card for the next 7 years. Just don't use it for grocery shopping—the earnings there are weak."

## The Deep Dive

If you are looking to get into the travel points game, this is where you start. The Chase Sapphire Preferred (CSP) is legendary for a reason: it's flexible.

### How much are the points actually worth?
Chase advertises the bonus as $600 cash. **Do not redeem them for cash.** That is a rookie mistake.

If you use the Chase Travel portal, they are worth **$750**. If you transfer them to Hyatt for a hotel stay, they could be worth **$1,200+**.

### Who is this card for?
1.  Travelers who want free flights but don't want a $500 annual fee card.
2.  People who spend a lot on dining (3x points).
3.  Anyone who rents cars (the primary insurance saves you ~$15/day).

### Who should skip it?
If you never travel, get the **Citi Double Cash** instead. Paying $95 for travel points you won't use is just donating money to Chase.
