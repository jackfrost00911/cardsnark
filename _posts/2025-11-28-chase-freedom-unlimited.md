verdict: "The Chase Freedom Unlimited is the credit card equivalent of a reliable Honda Accord: not sexy, not flashy, but damn good at its job. It earns 1.5% on everything with zero annual fee. But pair it with a Chase Sapphire Preferred, and suddenly you're earning transferable points that can be worth 2-3x more. This isn't just a cash back card—it's a points factory."

## The Deep Dive

The flat-rate card that plays well with others. If you pair it with a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve, your "1.5%" suddenly becomes worth 1.87-3+ cents per dollar spent.

### The Chase Trifecta Strategy
This is why credit card nerds won't shut up about Chase. You combine three cards to maximize every dollar:

* **Chase Freedom Unlimited:** 1.5% on everything (The Catch-All).
* **Chase Freedom Flex:** 5% rotating categories (The Specialist).
* **Chase Sapphire Preferred:** 25% redemption bonus & transfer partners (The Hub).

### Earning Breakdown
* **5% (5x points):** Travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards portal.
* **3% (3x points):** Dining and drugstores.
* **1.5% (1.5x points):** Everything else.

### Why 1.5% Beats 2% (Sometimes)
Citi Double Cash gives you 2% flat cash back. Freedom Unlimited gives 1.5% in Chase Ultimate Rewards points. If you have a Sapphire Preferred, you can transfer those points to airline partners where they can be worth **3+ cents per dollar**. That's why optimizers choose Freedom Unlimited over higher flat-rate cards.

### Additional Perks
* **Cell Phone Protection:** Pay your bill with this card, get up to $800 coverage ($50 deductible).
* **Purchase Protection:** Covers new purchases against damage/theft for 120 days.

### The 5/24 Rule (Important!)
Chase has an unwritten rule: if you've opened 5+ credit cards (from ANY issuer) in the past 24 months, you're auto-denied. If you want Chase cards, get them early.
