## The Deep Dive

The Bilt Mastercard is in a league of its own. It turns your biggest monthly expense into free travel. It is the only "must-have" card for renters. Period.

### The Math (Free Money?)
If you pay $2,000/month in rent, this card gives you 24,000 points a year for free. That's a round-trip flight or a few nights at a Hyatt.

* **Annual Fee:** $0.
* **Rent Transaction Fee:** $0 (Normally 3%).
* **Points on Rent:** 1x (up to 100k points/year).

### How the "Rent" Thing Actually Works
Usually, paying rent with a credit card incurs a 3% fee. Bilt gives you a unique Routing Number and Account Number. To your landlord, it looks like an ACH bank transfer. To you, it's a credit card charge earning points. Does your landlord only take checks? Bilt will print a paper check and mail it to them for free.

### The "5 Times" Rule (Don't Screw This Up)
This is the only catch, and it's a big one. To earn your rent points, you must make **5 transactions** on the card every statement period.

**The Strategy:** Your rent payment counts as 1. You need 4 more. Buy a coffee, pay your Netflix bill, buy a pack of gum. Just make sure you hit 5, or your points vanish.

### "Rent Day" (The First of the Month)
On the 1st of every month, Bilt doubles the rewards on non-rent spend:

* **Dining:** 6x points
* **Travel:** 4x points
* **Everything Else:** 2x points

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You pay rent.
2.  You love Hyatt or United points (Bilt is one of the few cards that transfers to both).
3.  You want a solid dining card (3x) with no annual fee.
