verdict: "The Ink Business Unlimited is the Toyota Corolla of business credit cards. It is not exciting. It doesn't have flashy perks. It won't get you into a lounge. But it works every single time without complaint. It earns a flat 1.5% cash back on every single purchase, with no annual fee. If you run a business where your expenses are weird—like 'Contractor Labor' or 'Lumber' or 'Vintage Pokémon Cards'—and don't fit into normal bonus categories, this is your card."

## The Deep Dive

For business owners who are too busy to remember if "Office Supplies" earns 2x or 3x this month, the Ink Business Unlimited is the perfect solution.

### The Barrier to Entry
The bonus is basically free money: Spend $6,000 on your business in 3 months, get **$750 back**. That is a 12.5% return on spend, which is insane for a no-fee card.

* **Annual Fee:** $0.
* **Sign-up Bonus:** $750 cash back (requires $6,000 spend).
* **Employee Cards:** Free.

### The "Business" Loophole
You do not need to be a Fortune 500 CEO to get this card. Do you sell things on Etsy? Do you freelance? Do you tutor? Apply as a **Sole Proprietor** using your Social Security Number. Your "Business Name" is just your own name. Chase loves sole proprietors.

### Why 1.5% is Better Than You Think
Even though the Citi Double Cash gets 2%, the Ink Unlimited has two advantages:
1.  **The Bonus:** This card gives you $750 just for signing up. It would take you spending $150,000 on a 2% card to beat that head start.
2.  **The "Trifecta" Play:** If you also have a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Ink Preferred, you can move the cash back from this card to that card. Suddenly, your 1.5% cash back becomes **1.5x Ultimate Rewards points**, which are worth way more when redeemed for Hyatt or United flights.

### 0% APR: The Inventory Hack
The Ink Unlimited comes with **0% Intro APR for 12 months** on purchases. If you need to buy $5,000 of inventory, a new laptop, or a camera for your business, you can put it on this card and pay it off slowly over a year without paying a dime in interest.

### Ink Unlimited vs. Ink Cash
Chase has two no-fee business cards. Get the **Ink Unlimited** if your spending is all over the place (Contractors, Inventory, Rent). Get the **Ink Cash** if you spend a lot on Office Supply Stores or Internet/Phone bills (where it earns 5%).
