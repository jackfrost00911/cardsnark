## The Deep Dive

The Chase Freedom Student was once the "backdoor" entrance into the Chase ecosystem for students with thin credit files. While it offered a modest 1% cash back, its real value was building a history with Chase. However, Chase has officially retired this card for new applicants and replaced it with the superior **Chase Freedom Rise**.

### For Existing Cardholders: Should You Keep It?
**Yes.** There is no annual fee, so keeping it open helps your average age of credit. Plus, you get a **$20 Good Standing Reward** every year for your first 5 years. That's free money just for having the card.

### The "Lyft" Benefit
Existing cardholders can still earn **2% total cash back** on Lyft rides through September 30, 2027. While not as high as the Sapphire Reserve's 10x, it's better than the standard 1%.

### The Replacement: Chase Freedom Rise
If you are a student looking for a Chase card today, you want the **Freedom Rise**. Here is how they compare:

* **Freedom Student (Old):** 1% Cash Back, $20 Annual Bonus.
* **Freedom Rise (New):** 1.5% Cash Back, $25 Autopay Bonus.
* **The Winner:** The Freedom Rise is mathematically better for spending.

### The Strategy: The "Product Change"
If you have held the Freedom Student card for at least 12 months, you may be eligible to upgrade it. Call the number on the back of your card and ask if you can **Product Change** to the **Chase Freedom Unlimited®** (which earns 1.5% to 3%) or the **Chase Freedom Flex®** (which earns 5% in rotating categories). This lets you keep your credit history while getting a better card.
