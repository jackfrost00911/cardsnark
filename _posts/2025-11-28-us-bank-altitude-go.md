rating: 4.8
verdict: "The U.S. Bank Altitude Go is the best-kept secret in credit cards. While everyone else screams about the Amex Gold ($325 fee), this card earns 4x points on dining with a $0 annual fee. However, as of April 2025, that 4x rate is now capped at $2,000 spent per quarter. It’s still a beast for most people, but big spenders should beware."

## The Deep Dive

The U.S. Bank Altitude Go is the "Amex Gold" for people who refuse to pay annual fees. It doesn't have fancy travel partners, but if your main goal is "get free money for eating tacos," this card is nearly unbeatable.

### The 4x Dining "Glitch" (Now Patched?)
Usually, to get 4x on dining, you have to pay an annual fee. The Altitude Go gives it to you for free. However, starting April 14, 2025, U.S. Bank is adding a **$2,000 quarterly cap** to the 4x dining category.

**The Math:**
* If you spend **$666 or less per month** on dining, this cap doesn't affect you. You still earn 4x on everything.
* If you spend **more than $1,000 per month** on dining, you are better off with the Capital One SavorOne (unlimited 3x).

### The $15 Streaming Credit
This is a quirky benefit, but it's free money. If you pay for a streaming service (Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, etc.) with this card for **11 consecutive months**, U.S. Bank gives you a **$15 statement credit**. Basically, they buy you one month of Netflix every year just for using their card.

### Altitude Go vs. SavorOne
This is the main showdown. Both have $0 annual fees.

* **Altitude Go:** Wins on Dining (4x) *if* you spend under $2,000/quarter.
* **SavorOne:** Wins on Groceries & Entertainment (3x unlimited).
* **The Verdict:** If you are a moderate spender who eats out often, Altitude Go wins. If you are a big spender or cook at home, get the SavorOne.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You spend a lot on food/drinks but hate annual fees.
2.  You travel internationally (No foreign transaction fees makes this a great backup card).
3.  You spend less than $2,000 per quarter on dining.
