## The Deep Dive

The Amex Business Platinum is a status symbol that actually works hard for you—if you know how to use it. The $695 fee is scary, but the $1,000+ in potential value is undeniable.

### The Math (Does the fee make sense?)
This card only works if you use the credits. Here is the breakdown:

* **Annual Fee:** $695
* **Dell Credit:** -$400 ($200 twice a year)
* **Airline Credit:** -$200 (Incidentals only)
* **Wireless Credit:** -$120 ($10/month)
* **Net Cost:** <strong class="text-green-600">-$25 (Profit)</strong>

**The Verdict:** If your business buys electronics from Dell, pays a phone bill, and flies on airplanes, Amex is paying you to hold this card. If you don't use those credits, you're just lighting $695 on fire.

### The Secret Weapon: 35% Rebate
This feature separates the Business Platinum from the Personal Platinum. If you use Membership Rewards points to book a flight on your selected airline (or ANY business/first class flight) through Amex Travel, you get **35% of those points back**.

> *Why this matters:* Normally, 100,000 points gets you $1,000 of travel. With this rebate, 100,000 points gets you roughly **$1,540** of travel.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1. You travel for business at least 4-5 times a year.
2. You buy computers/electronics from Dell.
3. You want elite status at Hilton and Marriott.
