## The Deep Dive

The Citi Strata Premier (formerly the Citi Premier) is the most underrated card on the market. It doesn't get as much hype as Chase or Amex because it's not "sexy." But look at the math: 3x on Gas, Grocery, Dining, and Travel covers 80% of most people's spending.

### The Math (Does it add up?)
If you take one trip a year and book a hotel through Citi, they literally pay you $5 to keep this card.

* **Annual Fee:** $95.
* **Hotel Credit:** -$100 (If you book a $500+ stay via Citi).
* **Net Annual Cost:** <strong class="text-blue-800">-$5 (Profit)</strong>

### The "Gas Station" Advantage
This is the killer feature. The Chase Sapphire Preferred earns 0x on gas. The Amex Gold earns 0x on gas. The Citi Strata Premier earns **3x on Gas Stations** (and EV charging). If you commute or enjoy road trips, this card fits your wallet better than the competition.

### The "Citi Trifecta" (Power User Move)
If you want to be a credit card wizard, you pair this card with the **Citi® Double Cash**. Use the Strata Premier for Gas, Grocery, Dining, and Travel (3x), and use the Double Cash for everything else (2x). You will never earn less than 2x points on any purchase, ever.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You spend money on Gas AND Groceries AND Dining (The Suburban Trifecta).
2.  You want one card that does it all for a low fee.
3.  You know how to transfer points to partners like Virgin Atlantic or Avianca.
