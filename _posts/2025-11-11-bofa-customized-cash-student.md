verdict: "Being a student is chaotic. One month you're buying textbooks, the next you're buying gas for a road trip. A normal credit card locks you into one category. The Bank of America Student Cash Rewards card lets you choose your own 3% category and change it every month. It's the only student card that adapts to your life."

## The Deep Dive

Because you spend money on different things during Finals Week than you do on Spring Break, you need a card that adapts.

### The Offer (Power of Choice)
* **Annual Fee:** $0.
* **3% Category:** You pick (Gas, Online Shopping, Dining, Travel, Drug Stores, or Home Improvement).
* **2% Categories:** Grocery Stores & Wholesale Clubs.

**The Verdict:** Most students should pick "Online Shopping" or "Dining." Earning 3% on Amazon orders or Uber Eats with a starter card is excellent value.

### The Strategy: How to Hack It
Don't just set it and forget it. Be smart about your 3% category:

* **August/January (Back to School):** Set it to "Online Shopping" for textbooks and dorm supplies.
* **Spring Break:** Set it to "Travel" or "Gas."
* **Finals Week:** Set it to "Dining" for all the stress-eating takeout.
* **Moving Day:** Set it to "Home Improvement" for furniture.

### Bank of America vs. Discover Student
These are the two heavyweights. Discover offers 5% rotating categories (you can't choose them) and a cashback match in year 1. Bank of America offers a 3% fixed category (you choose it) and a $200 bonus.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You do a lot of online shopping (Amazon, clothes, tech).
2.  You already have a checking account with Bank of America (helps approval odds).
3.  You want a $200 bonus right now.
