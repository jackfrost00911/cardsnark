rating: 4.8
verdict: "The Ink Business Preferred is the heavyweight champion of business cards. It usually offers the biggest sign-up bonus in the entire Chase ecosystem. Even if your 'business' is just selling vintage t-shirts on eBay, you probably qualify for this card. It earns 3x points on things that actually matter to business owners: Ads, Shipping, and Internet."

## The Deep Dive

For anyone who has sold a used couch on Facebook Marketplace and called it a "Logistics Company," this card is for you. It is the best way to jumpstart your Ultimate Rewards balance.

### The Barrier to Entry
The bonus is massive (usually 100k points), but the catch is the spend requirement. You must spend **$8,000 in the first 3 months** to get it. If you can't hit that number naturally, do not apply. We don't want you buying 8,000 rolls of toilet paper just to get points.

### Do You Even Have a "Business"?
You probably qualify. You don't need an LLC or storefront. You can apply as a **Sole Proprietor** using your Social Security Number. Do you sell stuff on eBay? Tutor kids? Drive Uber? Freelance write? Congratulations, you are a business.

### The 3x Categories (Where the Magic Happens)
This card earns 3 points per $1 on the first $150,000 spent in combined categories each year:

* **Online Advertising:** Google/Facebook Ads (A goldmine for dropshippers).
* **Shipping:** FedEx, UPS, USPS.
* **Internet, Cable, & Phone:** Turns your monthly utility bills into points.

### Cell Phone Protection
If you pay your monthly cell phone bill with this card, you (and employees listed on the bill) are covered against theft or damage up to $600 per claim ($100 deductible). AppleCare+ costs like $200. This card costs $95. Do the math.

### Ink Preferred vs. Sapphire Preferred
They both cost $95. Get the **Ink Preferred** if you want the bigger bonus (100k vs 60k) and spend money on ads/shipping. Get the **Sapphire Preferred** if you want 3x on Dining/Streaming and your main spend is personal. Pro move: Get both and combine the points.
