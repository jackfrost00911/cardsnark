verdict: "Most 'student' credit cards treat you like a liability. Discover treats you like a future CEO. The Discover it® Student Cash Back gives you 5% cash back in rotating categories, doubles your cash back at the end of the first year, and literally pays you cash if you get good grades. It is the gold standard for your first card."

## The Deep Dive

Discover it® Student Cash Back is a full-featured rewards card disguised as a starter card. Getting approved with no credit history is rare; getting approved AND earning 5% cash back is unheard of.

### The "Cash Back Match" (Why Year 1 is Insane)
This is Discover's secret weapon. Instead of a small upfront bonus, they match ALL the cash back you earn in your first year.

**The Math:** If you max out the 5% categories every quarter ($6,000 spend total), you earn $300. At the end of the year, Discover gives you another $300. That means you effectively earn **10% cash back** on rotating categories in your first year.

### Get Paid for Good Grades
If your GPA is 3.0 or higher, Discover gives you a **$20 statement credit**. You can claim this every year for up to 5 years. That's $100 just for passing your classes.

### The "Rotating Categories" Explained
Every 3 months, the 5% categories change. You have to log into the app and click "Activate." Typical categories include:

* **Q1 (Jan-Mar):** Grocery Stores or Gyms.
* **Q2 (Apr-Jun):** Gas Stations or Home Improvement.
* **Q3 (Jul-Sep):** Restaurants or PayPal.
* **Q4 (Oct-Dec):** Amazon.com and Target.

### Who Should Get This Card?
1.  You are a college student (undergrad or grad).
2.  You have no credit history and want to start building it.
3.  You plan to study abroad (No foreign transaction fees!).
